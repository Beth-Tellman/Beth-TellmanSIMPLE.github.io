I am a human-environment geographer seeking to understand, map, and mitigate the causes and consequences of global environmental change with and for marginalized populations. I am currently a Postdoctoral Scientist at the Earth Institute at Columbia University, mentored by Dr. Upmanu Lall at the Columbia Water Center and Dr. Dan Osgood at from the Financial Instruments Sector Team at the International Research Institute for Cliamte and Society. I will be Assistant Professor of Geography at the University of Arizona in August 2021 and am PhD recruiting students and postdocs! See [opportunities](https://beth-tellman.github.io/opportunities/) for more information.


I engage in a wide array of disciplines and methods from land system science, to hydrology, to the social sciences. I received my PhD in Geography from Arizona State University. My recent published work analyzes social vulnerability to floods, narcotrafficking as a cause of deforestation in Central America, and mapping floods from satellites. 

I am also the Chief Science Officer and Co-founder of [Cloud to Street](https://www.cloudtostreet.info/), a public benefit corporation which leverages remote sensing data to build flood mapping and monitoring systems for low and middle income countries. I oversees the Cloud to Street science team to map flood exposure, risk, and social vulnerability. My passion for reducing flood vulnerability comes from working in flood relief and resilience efforts in El Salvador from 2009-2012.
